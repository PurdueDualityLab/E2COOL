Task Instructions:
- Analyze the provided source code to identify the most suitable energy optimization patterns that can improve its efficiency.
    - Use the pattern descriptions and examples as references when evaluating the code.
    - Justify your selection based on the code's structure, operations, and areas with potential energy inefficiencies.
- Select the top five most relevant energy optimization patterns from the identified options.
- For each selected pattern, generate a detailed prompt that will be used by another LLM assistant.
    - This prompt should inlcude the name and description of the energy optimization pattern as well as how to apply it effectively.
    - Incorporate specific details from the source code that are relevant to the pattern.
- Output Requirements:
    - Return only the five generated prompts, with no additional explanation or justification.
